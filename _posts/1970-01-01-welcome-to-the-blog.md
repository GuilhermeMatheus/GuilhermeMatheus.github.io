Hello, world.

“Hello, world” sounds different for each person, especially for those who work with technology. For some, it means they are starting to learn something new; for others, it’s a kind of `ping` check for some functionality; there are also the people who salted this phrase with the beginning of a huge change in their and others life. Let's not forget about the technologists which don't use “Hello world” a lot, but are poets of “asdfsdfsaf” or even [amulets](https://text.bargains/amulet/){:target="_blank"}.

This is the very first post to my blog.
Maybe you've noticed some incompleteness here. That's the spirit of the thing: hello, world.

I have some ideas for the landing page, blog design and content. So, why not share the process while delivering it?

The agenda _(no specific order)_ for the next days is:
- _Something about the blog (presentation and blog aims)_;
- Looking at what programs are doing with `strace`;
- _Something about the blog (landing page)_;
- CGroups (container part 2?);
- _Something about the blog (idk what yet)_;
- eBPF;
- Docker Image Manifest and OCI image format (container part n-1?);

See you.

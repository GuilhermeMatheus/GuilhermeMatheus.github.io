# Guilherme's GitHub pages repo :)

This is my [GuilhermeMatheus.github.io](https://GuilhermeMatheus.github.io) repository for GitHub pages.

I'm using Jekyll as this is the supported and suggested way of using GitHub pages.

### Requirements

In order to preview this site and serve it locally, make sure you have Jekyll installed on your machine. The [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) is the best place for installation instructions.

### Running it
Use `jekyll serve` and voil√†, the blog will be available on http://127.0.0.1:4000/.
